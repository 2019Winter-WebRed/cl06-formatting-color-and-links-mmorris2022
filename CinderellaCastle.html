           <p> The Cinderella Castle Suite is the only place that you can stay overnight inside Disneyâ€™s Magic Kingdom. However, only a very limited amount of people will ever get to stay there.</p>
            <br />

            
            <p>Disney World first announced the creation of the Cinderella Suite in 2006. The space which is now the Cinderella Castle Suite was originally intended to be a place that Walt Disney and his family would stay in the park. Sadly, Walt Disney never got to see his creation as he died in December 1966, almost five years before the Magic Kingdom opened.</p>

             <p>The bedroom has 2 beautiful Queen sized beds facing an ornate fireplace. Above the fireplace is a 17th-century style portrait of Cinderella. However, all is not what it seems as the portrait magically transforms into a flat screen television! There is even a remote control for the lights and the fireplace.</p>
            <br />
          
            
            <p>The bathroom houses a huge garden tub with ornate stained glass windows and a twinkling star ceiling.</p>
